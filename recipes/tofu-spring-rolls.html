<h1>Tofu Spring Rolls</h1>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
	<li>1 block extra firm tofu</li>
	<li>1.5 tbsp cooking oil</li>
	<li>Optional dry seasoning for tofu</li>
	<li>2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
	<li>Choice of sauce (peanut sauce is what I use)</li>
	<li>Savoy cabbage (will use about 1/2 of a head, double recipe to use whole head)</li>
	<li>Choice of vegetables to go in the spring rolls (cucumber, carrot, etc)</li>
	<li>Spring roll wrappers</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>Prepare tofu</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Preheat oven to 425F</li>
	<li>
		<i>Either:</i>
		<ul>
			<li>Freeze, defrost, then lightly squeeze most of the water out of the tofu by hand (takes a few seconds to squeeze most of the water out once defrosted) (freezing leads to a slightly different texture and makes it absorb more flavor on the inside if you go an extra mile to marinade it)</li>
			<li>Press most of the water out of the tofu (takes about 15 minutes)</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Cut or rip tofu into pieces, then put it in a mixing bowl</li>
	<li>Coat tofu in cooking oil and dry seasoning if using, and gently mix with hands</li>
	<li>Coat tofu evenly in cornstarch, and gently mix with hands</li>
	<li>Bake tofu on parchment paper for 30-40 minutes, flipping the pieces halfway</li>
</ul>
<h3>Make spring rolls</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Prepare tofu, sauce if using (like <a href="https://sliepke.github.io/recipes/peanut-sauce.html">peanut sauce</a>), and any vegetables you're using</li>
	<li>Make spring rolls (this is the hard part and takes practice)
	<ul>
		<li>Spring roll wrappers have to be soaked in water for a few seconds before using</li>
		<li>The tofu, sauce, and vegetables are to be wrapped in cabbage leaves as compactly as possible, and the cabbage is to be wrapped in the spring roll wrapper</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
