						<h2>Time flies: Comparing Completion Times of 3 Plane Disembarking Strategies</h2>
						<p>(PDF, 399KB)</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>What is the fastest way to deboard the passengers of an airplane? Do you tell everyone to deboard all at once? Or maybe call people off one row at a time? This independent mathematical modeling project aims to find the answer using a simulation written in Python, and investigates how the passengers' number of carry-ons and likelihood of noncompliance to your strategy affects the different strategies' performances. Final project for Mathematical Modeling (Math 421) at RIT.</p>
